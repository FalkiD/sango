05/14/2017  JLC  Commit for refactoring of s4 to have a top-level of s4.v (in lieu of top.v).
                 This commit includes slightly modified versions of some of JOhn Clayton's
                 mmc VHDL files.  s4.v is top-level.  mmc_tester, opcodes, and uart are 
                 top-level members.
