REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 mmc_tester_0/host_0_bram_0/ram1_reg_0 has an input control pin mmc_tester_0/host_0_bram_0/ram1_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: mmc_tester_0/host_0_bram_0/ADDRARDADDR[13]) which is driven by a register (mmc_tester_0/syscon1/syscon1/adr_offset_reg[13]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 mmc_tester_0/mmc_slave/mmc_1/ext_csd_ram/ram1_reg has an input control pin mmc_tester_0/mmc_slave/mmc_1/ext_csd_ram/ram1_reg/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: mmc_tester_0/mmc_slave/mmc_1/ext_csd_ram/Q[7]) which is driven by a register (mmc_tester_0/mmc_slave/mmc_1/ext_csd_reg_adr_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
