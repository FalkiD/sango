Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:            70 out of   7,168    1%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:                82 out of   7,168    1%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:             98 out of   3,584    2%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:      98 out of      98 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of      98   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         142 out of   7,168    1%
    Number used as logic:                82
    Number used as a route-thru:         60

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                107 out of     195   54%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       4
    IOB Master Pads:                      4
    IOB Slave Pads:                       4
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%
  Number of SPI_ACCESSs:                  1 out of       1  100%
